There are several types of sea animals. Some of them live in the seas, while some of them thrive around the seas.<br>

Fish – Fish are the sea animals that live and breathe underwater, have scaly skin, fins, and gills; for example, goldfish, guppy, catfish, bluefish, swordfish, sharks, manta rays, etc.<br>
Sea Mammals – Sea mammals are the animals that are dependent on the seas for survival; for example, whales, sea otters, sea lions, polar bears, etc.<br>
Seabirds – Seabirds live within the marine environment but not underwater; for example, seagulls, skimmers, penguins, albatross, gannets, etc.<br>
Marine Reptiles – These are the reptiles that can live in and around the seas, for example, sea turtles and saltwater crocodiles. Once upon a time, our planet had a large number of marine reptiles that are now extinct because could not evolve and survive.<br>
Mollusc – Molluscs are animals with soft bodies and hard shells that protect their bodies. Oysters, snails, octopuses, and squids are some molluscs found in the seas.<br>
Other Sea Animals – Other animals found in seas are sponges, corals, sea pineapple, sea squirts, etc.
