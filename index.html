<h3>Sea animals are the animals that live deep in the seas.<br> These include fish, like sharks, pufferfish, angelfish; molluscs like snails, clams, and oysters; <br>crustaceans like crabs and shrimps; and mammals like whales, dolphins, sea lions, walruses, etc.<br> Some birds, like the seagull, and reptiles like saltwater crocodiles and turtles are also known as sea animals.
</h3>
<h3>
There are several types of sea animals. Some of them live in the seas, while some of them thrive around the seas.<br>

HERE IS A VIDEO ABOUT SEA LIFE:

Fish- Live in water, have scaly skin, fins, and gills; for example, goldfish, guppy, catfish, bluefish, swordfish, sharks, manta rays, etc.<br>
Sea Mammals – Sea mammals are the animals that are dependent on the seas for survival; for example, whales, sea otters, sea lions, polar bears, etc.<br>
Seabirds – Seabirds live within the marine environment but not underwater; for example, seagulls, skimmers, penguins, albatross, gannets, etc.<br>
Marine Reptiles – These are the reptiles that can live in and around the seas, for example, sea turtles and saltwater crocodiles. Once upon a time, our planet had a large number of marine reptiles that are now extinct because could not evolve and survive.<br>
Mollusc – Molluscs are animals with soft bodies and hard shells that protect their bodies. Oysters, snails, octopuses, and squids are some molluscs found in the seas.<br>
Other Sea Animals – Other animals found in seas are sponges, corals, sea pineapple, sea squirts, etc.

DID YOU KNOW? <H2/>
</h2> <H3>
Experts have estimated that about one million species live in the ocean, which would be roughly 90 percent of all living creatures. Of those one million species, about 95 percent are invertebrates, meaning things that don't have a backbone such as jellyfish and shrimp.One study of a deep-sea community revealed 898 species from more than 100 families and a dozen phyla in an area about half the size of a tennis court. More than half of these were new to science. Life began in the ocean 3.1 billion to 3.4 billion years ago.One study of a deep-sea community revealed 898 species from more than 100 families and a dozen phyla in an area about half the size of a tennis court.

Jellyfish Facts!</h2>
<h4>
Jellyfish have been around for millions of years, even before dinosaurs lived on the Earth. Pulsing along on our ocean currents, these jelly-like creatures can be found in waters both cold and warm, deep and shallow and along coastlines, too.<br> Some jellyfish are clear, but others are vibrant colours of pink, yellow, blue and purple. They can be bioluminescent, too, which means they produce their own light!Jellyfish have no brain, heart, bones or eyes. <br>They are made up of a smooth, bag-like body and tentacles armed with tiny, stinging cells. <br>These incredible invertebrates use their stinging tentacles to stun or paralyse prey before gobbling it up.<br><br>

<br>The jellyfish’s mouth is found in the centre of its body. From this small opening it both eats and discards waste. And it serves another purpose, too – by squirting a jet of water from its mouth, the jellyfish can propel forward!

<h2>Sea Horse Facts!</h2>
<h4>
Seahorses are tiny fish that are named for the shape of their head, which looks like the head of….yup, you guessed it -a tiny horse. There are around 36 seahorse species, which are found in tropical and temperate coastal waters where they swim upright among seaweed and other plants.

Seahorses’ bodies are covered in tiny, spiny plates, all the way from their head down to their curled, flexible tail. The tail can grasp objects, which comes in handy when these cool critters want to anchor themselves to vegetation.<br> To move forward through the water, seahorses use their dorsal fin (back fin). To move up and down, they adjust the volume of air in a tiny pocket inside their body.<br></h4>

<h2>10 Turtle Facts!</h2>
<h4>
1. Turtles belong to one of the oldest reptile groups in the world – beating snakes, crocodiles and alligators!<br><br>

2. These creatures date back to the time of the dinosaurs, over 200 million years ago!<br> <br>
3. Turtles are easily recognised by their bony, cartilaginous shell. This super-tough casing acts like a shield to protect them from predators – some turtles can even tuck their head up inside their shell for extra protection!<br><br>
4. Just like your bones, a turtle’s shell is actually part of its skeleton. It’s made up of over 50 bones which include the turtle’s rib cage and spine.<br><br>
5. Contrary to popular belief, a turtle cannot come out of its shell. The turtle’s shell grows with them, so it’s impossible for them to grow too big for it!<br><br>
<img src="https://cdn.creatureandcoagency.com/uploads/2017/02/turtle-facts-3.jpg" width=300 height=200><br><br>

6. What a turtle eats depends on the environment it lives in. Land-dwelling turtles will munch on beetles, fruit and grass, whereas sea dwellers will gobble everything from algae to squid and jellyfish.<br><br>
7. Some turtles are carnivores (meat eaters), others are herbivores (plant eaters) and some are omnivores (a mixture of the two!). Many baby turtles start life as carnivores but grow to eat more plants as they mature.<br><br>

8. Turtles are ‘amniotes’ – they breathe air and lay their eggs on land, although many species live in or around water.
<br><br>
9. These cold-blooded creatures have an incredibly long life span. The oldest ever recorded, named Tu”i Malila, of Tonga Island, passed away at the grand old age of 188!<br><br>

10. Sadly, many species of turtle are endangered! 129 of approximately 300 species of turtle and tortoise on Earth today are either vulnerable, endangered, or critically endangered, according to the IUCN. Threats include loss of habitat, pollution, poaching and the illegal pet trade.<br><br></h4>
<h2>Humpback Whale Facts!</h2>
<h4>
Humpbacks are known for singing loud, complex “songs” – lasting up to 30 minutes long! The sounds they make are the most varied in the animal kingdom, ranging from high-pitched squeals and whistles to low, rumbling gurgles. Only males “sing” and experts think they do it to attract females or to let other males know they’re in the area.<br>These whales are found near coastlines, feeding on tiny, shrimplike krill, plankton and small fish. Humpbacks migrate annually from summer feeding grounds near the poles to warmer winter breeding waters closer to the Equator.<br>Mothers and their young swim close together, often touching one another with their flippers with what appear to be gestures of affection. Females nurse their calves for almost a year, though it takes far longer than that for a humpback whale to reach full adulthood. Calves do not stop growing until they are ten years old.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.creatureandcoagency.com/uploads/2013/09/201403010343221529150603.jpg"width=300 height=200><br><br>Humpbacks are powerful swimmers, and they use their massive tail fin, called a fluke, to propel themselves through the water and sometimes completely out of it. These whales, like others, regularly “breach“. This is when the whales leap from the water before landing with a tremendous splash. Scientists aren’t sure if this breaching behaviour serves some purpose, such as cleaning pests from the whale’s skin, or whether whales simply do it for fun!</h4>
