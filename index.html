<h3>Sea animals are the animals that live deep in the seas.<br> These include fish, like sharks, pufferfish, angelfish; molluscs like snails, clams, and oysters; <br>crustaceans like crabs and shrimps; and mammals like whales, dolphins, sea lions, walruses, etc.<br> Some birds, like the seagull, and reptiles like saltwater crocodiles and turtles are also known as sea animals.

<h3>
There are several types of sea animals. Some of them live in the seas, while some of them thrive around the seas.<br>

Fish- Live in water, have scaly skin, fins, and gills; for example, goldfish, guppy, catfish, bluefish, swordfish, sharks, manta rays, etc.<br>
Sea Mammals – Sea mammals are the animals that are dependent on the seas for survival; for example, whales, sea otters, sea lions, polar bears, etc.<br>
Seabirds – Seabirds live within the marine environment but not underwater; for example, seagulls, skimmers, penguins, albatross, gannets, etc.<br>
Marine Reptiles – These are the reptiles that can live in and around the seas, for example, sea turtles and saltwater crocodiles. Once upon a time, our planet had a large number of marine reptiles that are now extinct because could not evolve and survive.<br>
Mollusc – Molluscs are animals with soft bodies and hard shells that protect their bodies. Oysters, snails, octopuses, and squids are some molluscs found in the seas.<br>
Other Sea Animals – Other animals found in seas are sponges, corals, sea pineapple, sea squirts, etc.

DID YOU KNOW? <H2/>

Experts have estimated that about one million species live in the ocean, which would be roughly 90 percent of all living creatures. Of those one million species, about 95 percent are invertebrates, meaning things that don't have a backbone such as jellyfish and shrimp.One study of a deep-sea community revealed 898 species from more than 100 families and a dozen phyla in an area about half the size of a tennis court. More than half of these were new to science. Life began in the ocean 3.1 billion to 3.4 billion years ago.One study of a deep-sea community revealed 898 species from more than 100 families and a dozen phyla in an area about half the size of a tennis court.
